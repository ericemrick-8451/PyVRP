    ----------
    weight_capacity_penalty
        The penalty for each unit of excess weight load over the vehicle weight capacity.
    volume_capacity_penalty
        The penalty for each unit of excess volume load over the vehicle volume capacity.
    salvage_capacity_penalty
        The penalty for each nonterminal salvage pickup.
    salvage_sequence_penalty
        The penalty for each nonterminal salvage pickup.
    tw_penalty
        The penalty for each unit of time warp.
